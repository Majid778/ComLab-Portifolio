Project Name: Commlab Portifolio

Project Description:

The purpose of this project was to create a website to showcase all of my Commlab projects. The website features three main sections: Home, About, and Projects. 

Process:

I started by sketching out a wireframe of the website's layout, which helped me visualize how I wanted to structure the content. Next, I experimented with different color palettes before ultimately deciding on a clean, minimalist design with a beige background and orange text. I also incorporated a brown color to add some visual contrast.

In terms of the technical implementation, I used HTML and CSS to create the website's structure and styling, respectively. I also used AOS data to add animations to various elements of the page. Finally, I added anchor points to help with positioning and scrolling.

The animation of the navigation bar was also something I was experimenting with which I think turned out quite well. It adds to the overall feel and user experience when first entering the website. The Project section consisted of adding the aos animation to multiple items then setting them to the same anchor so they all trigger at the same time causing the clean effect of all of the project cards converging.

Reflection/Evaluation:

Overall, I am pleased with how the website turned out. I was able to successfully showcase all of my Commlab projects in an organized and visually appealing manner. However, there is always room for improvement, and I would like to continue to refine and polish the design over time. Future improvements could include a section for my work experiences and qualifications and a button to download my actual CV so that employers would be able to use the site as well

One thing I think I did well in this project is the planning and sketching out the website's layout before beginning the technical implementation. This allowed me to better visualize how the website would look and function before actually starting to code.

The animations content were particularly challenging as I was unfamiliar with that particular library, but I was able to use AOS data and anchor points to achieve the desired effects.

In conclusion, this project was a valuable learning experience that helped me improve my web design skills and create a useful showcase of my Commlab projects as well as a good base for a CV website for employers.
