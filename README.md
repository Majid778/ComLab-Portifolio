Sure, here's an updated description of the project with some additional technical details:

Project Name: Commlab Portfolio

Project Description:

The goal of this project was to create a visually appealing and functional website to showcase all of my Commlab projects. The website features a clean and minimalist design, with a beige background and orange text for a modern and professional look. 

Process:

To create the website, I started by sketching out a wireframe to map out the layout and content structure. This allowed me to better visualize the website's overall design and functionality before starting the technical implementation. 

For the technical implementation, I used HTML and CSS to create the website's structure and styling, respectively. I also leveraged JavaScript and the AOS (Animate On Scroll) library to add smooth and engaging animations to various elements of the page. Additionally, I used anchor points to help with positioning and scrolling, which allows users to easily navigate between different sections of the website.

I also added hover animations to the navbar buttons and project boxes to make the website more visually appealing and interactive. I used CSS to define different hover states for the buttons, changing the background and text colors when the user hovers over them. This creates a dynamic effect that engages users and makes the website feel more polished.

For the project boxes, I used JavaScript and CSS to display a project description and a redirect button when the user hovers over them. This creates a clean and intuitive user experience that helps visitors navigate the website.

One of the key technical challenges in this project was figuring out and implementing the navigation bar animation. I used JavaScript and CSS to create a dynamic effect where the navigation bar slides right upon page load, and then remains fixed to the top of the screen as the user scrolls down. This helps to create a smooth and intuitive user experience.

Another challenging aspect of this project was creating the project section, which required me to add AOS animations to multiple items and set them to the same anchor point so that they all triggered simultaneously. This created a clean and visually striking effect where all of the project cards converge at the same time.



Reflection/Evaluation:

Overall, I am pleased with how the website turned out. I was able to effectively showcase all of my Commlab projects in an organized and visually appealing manner, while also improving my web design and development skills in the process. Moving forward, I would like to continue refining and polishing the design, and potentially adding new features such as a section for my work experiences and qualifications. 

One thing that I learned from this project is the importance of careful planning and wireframing before starting the technical implementation. This allowed me to better visualize the website's overall design and functionality, which ultimately made the development process smoother and more efficient.

In conclusion, this project was a valuable learning experience that helped me to improve my web design and development skills, and I look forward to continuing to develop my portfolio website in the future.
